# About Me 
## My Interests
 I like bowling, walking my dog, driving and hanging out with friends.
## Websites I Recommend
 [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)- Whenever i get stuck or I'm trying to figure out something I've never done before i always end up watching a video on YouTube to help me understand.
[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/)- I recommend eBay because sometimes when I'm looking for an item its cheaper on eBay than Amazon, it could take an extra day to get to me.
